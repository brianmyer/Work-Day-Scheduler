## Description
![Alt text](<Assets/Screenshot 2023-08-02 at 9.50.57 AM.png>)

This application is a scheduler for the user's workday. The current date is displayed at the top of the page, and each hour block is color-coded to correspond with whether it is the current hour, in the past, or upcoming. The user is able to input text in each block and click the save button to the right, whereupon the text is saved to local storage and recalled when the page is refreshed.
